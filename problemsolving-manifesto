1. Read VERY carefully, make sure that you have read and understood each
word.

2. Understand the problem, come up with a solution before you have written
a single line of code. The solution should outline the data structures used,
how they will intreact and the general algorithm.

3. When implementing, start with the test case, not with the end input. Test
against the test case.

4. When something goes wrong find the place where the problem occurs and
analyze -- does the piece of code correspond to the required behavior, or maybe
it is caused by improper language tool usage, maybe some assuption about some
state is invalid etc.
